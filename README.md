# Uber-trip-Analysis
This project applies Machine Learning (ML) and EDA to [Specify Dataset/Topic]. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, training a predictive model (e.g., Regression/Classification), and visualizing key model insights and data patterns. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations and strong analytical results.
üöó Uber Operations Data Analysis (Jan-Feb 2015)
This repository contains operational data released under a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request detailing Uber's activity in a major metropolitan area (typically NYC) during the first two months of 2015. This dataset is excellent for performing foundational time series analysis and operational efficiency studies.

üìÇ Dataset Source & Structure
File Name	Records	Time Period
Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv	354	January 1, 2015 ‚Äì February 28, 2015

Export to Sheets
The data is aggregated daily by the dispatching base number, providing a granular look at supply and demand metrics.

üìö Data Dictionary
Column Name	Data Type	Description
dispatching_base_number	Categorical	A unique identifier representing the Uber operational base/hub responsible for dispatching vehicles.
date	Date/Object	The day the data was recorded (daily aggregation).
active_vehicles	Integer	The total number of unique active vehicles dispatched from that base on that specific date (Supply).
trips	Integer	The total number of trips completed by vehicles dispatched from that base on that specific date (Demand).

üí° Key Analysis Areas
This dataset is ideal for projects focusing on supply chain logistics, demand forecasting, and operational analytics:

Time Series Analysis & Seasonality:

Analyze daily and weekly trends in trips and active vehicles.

Identify differences in demand and supply between January and February.

Operational Efficiency:

Calculate a Trips per Active Vehicle metric for each base to determine which hubs are most efficient.

Compare the efficiency trends over time.

Base Performance Comparison:

Rank the dispatching bases by total trips to identify the highest-volume operations (key demand centers).

Supply-Demand Visualization:

Create a dashboard (e.g., in Power BI or Tableau) to visualize the relationship between active vehicles (supply) and trips (demand).

üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Tools
Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (for simple time series forecasting).

SQL: For preliminary data aggregation and queries.

Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, or Altair/Plotly.
